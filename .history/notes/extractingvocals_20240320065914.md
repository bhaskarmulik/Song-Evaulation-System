Certainly! To extract vocals from a song using a neural network, you'll need to modify your architecture and output layer. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Architecture Modification**:
    - Keep the initial part of your architecture (CNN layers followed by dense layers) as you proposed.
    - However, instead of a single output neuron with a sigmoid activation function, create **two output neurons**:
        - One for vocals (output 1).
        - One for non-vocals (output 0).
    - Use a **softmax activation function** for these output neurons. Softmax ensures that the sum of probabilities across both classes (vocals and non-vocals) is 1.

2. **Loss Function and Optimization**:
    - Use **categorical cross-entropy loss** since you now have multiple output classes (vocals and non-vocals).
    - Choose an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and an appropriate learning rate.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Convert audio signals to spectrograms (time-frequency representations) using techniques like Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
    - Normalize the spectrograms to have zero mean and unit variance.
    - Split your data into training, validation, and test sets.

4. **Output as Numpy Array**:
    - After training your model, you can extract the vocals by thresholding the probabilities.
    - For each time step in your spectrogram, if the probability of vocals (output 1) is above a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5), consider it as vocals.
    - Create a binary mask where 1 indicates vocals and 0 indicates non-vocals.
    - Multiply this mask with your original spectrogram to obtain the vocals-only spectrogram.
    - Inverse STFT can then convert the vocals-only spectrogram back to the time-domain signal.
    - Finally, you'll have the vocals extracted as a numpy array.

Remember to experiment with different hyperparameters and thresholds to optimize your model. Good luck with your project, and may your neural network sing beautifully! ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¤
