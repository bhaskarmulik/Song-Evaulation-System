1. **Distance Signal**: The distance signal is created by comparing the fundamental frequency (f0) series of a singing performance with a reference (usually a piano) f0 series. This comparison is done using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which aligns the two series in time, allowing for an accurate comparison despite any timing differences.

2. **Histogram Creation**: After obtaining the distance signal from DTW, a histogram is computed. This histogram has a predefined number of bins (150 in the case mentioned in the document) and represents the distribution of the distances between the two f0 series. The idea is that certain distances will be more common in good singing performances (close to the reference) and others in poor ones (far from the reference or with octave errors).

3. **Input Feature**: The histogram serves as the input feature for the logistic regression model. Each bin of the histogram effectively becomes a feature that describes the singing performance. The model uses these features to learn patterns that distinguish between high and low-quality singing.

4. **Model Training**: During training, the logistic regression model learns the weights (coefficients) for each histogram bin that best predict the quality of singing. The model learns to associate certain histogram patterns with high-quality singing and others with low-quality singing.

5. **Quality Assessment**: When assessing a new singing performance, the same process is followed to create a histogram from the distance signal. This histogram is then input into the trained logistic regression model, which outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood that the performance is of high quality.

This method allows for an objective assessment of singing quality based on the comparison of the singer's performance with a known reference, and the histogram captures the nuances of this comparison in a form that the logistic regression model can use for classification.
