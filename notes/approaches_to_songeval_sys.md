1. **Vocal Separation**:
    - You've mentioned using a binary mask to extract vocals. This is a common approach, and it's great that you're considering it.
    - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are suitable for audio signal processing tasks. Your plan of using two CNN layers followed by three dense layers is reasonable.
    - Make sure your network architecture is designed to handle audio data effectively. Consider using 1D convolutions to capture temporal patterns in the audio signals.

2. **Extracted Vocals**:
    - Once you've obtained the vocals using the binary mask, you'll have a representation of the isolated vocal track.
    - The next step is to compare these vocals. Here are some approaches:

3. **Similarity Measures**:
    - **Audio Features**:
        - Extract relevant audio features from the vocals. Common features include:
            - **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)**: Capture spectral characteristics.
            - **Chroma features**: Represent pitch information.
            - **Spectral contrast**: Describes the difference in amplitude between peaks and valleys in the spectrum.
            - **Zero-crossing rate**: Indicates how often the signal crosses zero.
        - Use these features to compute similarity scores (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) between different vocal tracks.
        - Pros: Simple and interpretable.
        - Cons: May not capture all nuances of vocal similarity.
    - **Traditional ML Models**:
        - Train a separate model (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines) using the extracted vocal features.
        - Pros: Well-established techniques, easy to implement.
        - Cons: May not handle complex relationships well.
    - **Deep Learning Models**:
        - You could train another neural network specifically for vocal similarity.
        - Input: Pair of vocal representations (e.g., MFCCs).
        - Output: A similarity score (e.g., between 0 and 1).
        - Pros: Can learn complex patterns.
        - Cons: Requires more data and training time.
    - **Classification Techniques**:
        - If you have labeled data (similar vs. dissimilar vocals), consider training a binary classifier.
        - Input: Pair of vocals.
        - Output: Class label (similar or dissimilar).
        - Pros: Provides a clear decision boundary.
        - Cons: Requires labeled data.

4. **Scoring Confidence**:
    - If you choose a similarity score (e.g., cosine similarity), you can directly use it as a confidence score.
    - For classification techniques, the predicted class probability can serve as the confidence score.

5. **Visualization**:
    - Display the similarity/confidence score to the user.
    - You could create a simple UI where users input two vocal tracks, and your system computes and displays the similarity/confidence score.

Remember that the choice of approach depends on your specific use case, available data, and computational resources. Experiment with different methods and evaluate their performance to find the best solution for your vocal similarity task! ðŸŽµðŸŽ¤
